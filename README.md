# Math Library

This library implements big-integers and rational numbers. Though the big-integers don't have size limits, some functions assume that a big-integer is less than 2^(2^31). It's safer to use numbers smaller than that.

This library is for **VERY ACCURATE** computation. If performance matters, don't use this library.
